Ran into an issue during `dnx web`: 
fail: Microsoft.AspNet.Server.Kestrel[13]
      An unhandled exception was thrown by the application.
      System.IO.IOException: kqueue() FileSystemWatcher has reached the maximum number of files to watch.

Ran `export MONO_MANAGED_WATCHER=false`, fixed it

run `npm install --save-dev <package>` to install package and save to package.json
